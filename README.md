# Google Cloud Product Checker
This project aims to provide a tool to check the availability of Google Cloud products in the different regions.

Why? I got tired of checking the availability of Google Cloud products in the different regions manually in the awful table provided by Google Cloud on https://cloud.google.com/about/locations.

## What I want
I just want a simple way to answer the following questions:

- Is this product available in this region?
- What are the regions where this product is available?
- What are the products available in this region?
- What are the regions where this product is not available?
- What are the products not available in this region?
